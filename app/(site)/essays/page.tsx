          If you are interested in reading my book reviews, which tend to be more frequent, please visit <a href='https://www.lee-up.org/' className='text-blue-500'>Lee UP</a>.
          Lee UP is the book club my friends and I funded while we were doing our undergraduate. Since then, I haven&apos;t stop posting the thoughts I have while reading a new book
          and I don&apos;t plan to do so. Appart from reading my reviews, I encourage you to take the time to read other kids&apos; reviews,
          I assure you that you will find some fascinating ideas.
