      <p>
        I was born and raised in Lima, Peru. I studied Economics & Finance for four years at Universidad del Pac√≠fico,
        but dropped out at the beginning of 2023 - on my last year. After gaining traction with my first startup idea,
        I arrived to the conclusion that I wanted to focus on education as a problem and I didn&apos;t felt that
        college was the route for me. Eventually, the startup failed, but I managed to convience my parents to transfer
        to Cal State, East Bay so I could be as close as possible to SF - the biggest tech hub in the world. In 2024, on the 9th
        of January, I arrived to the States, transferred as an upper division student and worked for a year remotely with software
        projects. Below, you can see them organized by dates.
